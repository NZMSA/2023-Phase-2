# 2023 Phase 2

Welcome to Phase 2 of the 2023 MSA programme! This year, Phase 2 consists of two components:

1. Technical
    - This repository represents the entire technical component of Phase 2, which will assess your technical skills
    - Complete this component individually using Phase 1 knowledge + the resources that the MSA team has provided in the folder for each stream

2. Non-Technical
    - Students who successfully pass the technical component of Phase 2 will be invited to participate in the non-technical component of Phase 2
    - The non-technical component will consist of events and workshops on presentation and communication skills with MSA team members and/or Microsoft employees in order to prepare students for interviews with employers who are looking for students with both strong technical and non-technical skills
    - The events above will take place between mid-August and mid-September with placements being confirmed by mid-September, more details will be announced via our [socials](https://linktr.ee/msanz) and via email to all participating students
    - Some events, such as interviews with employers, may be invite-only, in which case invitations may only be sent to the highest ranked students across Phase 1 and Phase 2 submissions after they have been marked
    - Students who do not actively participate in these events and workshops and take steps to improve based on any feedback provided by Microsoft may not be invited to be interviewed by employers

The expected workload for Phase 2 of each stream is 3-4 hours per week and builds upon the knowledge from Phase 1 of each stream. Furthermore, placements will be either in Software Development or Data Science, not both. As such, we recommend that you follow one stream only in order to manage your time effectively and build your knowledge and skills within one stream as much as you can in order to stand out to employers.

2. Create a repository inside your personal GitHub account to store all your work and clone that repository into your IDE (ignore any and all other branches, everything you need is in the main branch)
    - In your repository, we recommend that you create a folder for each part of your chosen stream to store your work for each part separately
    - Alternatively, feel free to clone this repository and then delete the folder for the stream you are not doing

3. Refer to the folder for each stream to get started:
    - [Data Science](https://github.com/NZMSA/2023-Phase-2/tree/main/data-science)
    - [Software Development](https://github.com/NZMSA/2023-Phase-2/tree/main/software-development)

## Submission

To complete the technical component of Phase 2 and submit evidence of your completion:
1. Ensure that you have:
- Completed all parts of your chosen stream/s by checking that you have included all items in your repository, as stated in the folder for your chosen stream

    - If you wish to keep your repository/ies private but still provide access to the MSA team for marking, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository) to add the MSA team (username: **msaccelerate**) as a collaborator to your repository and add the repository link/s into the submission form, or upload your code as a .zip file to a cloud storage service and share a link to that in the submission form.

- Included all files needed to run your code inside your repository so that it's easy for the MSA team to mark your submission
2. Submit this form by 11:59pm, Sunday 6 August: [MSA 2023 Phase 2 Submission](https://forms.office.com/r/XSALRL2AC4)

The MSA programme strictly enforces academic integrity and students that do not submit their own work will first be notified with our concerns, and if your work is determined to be copied from someone/somewhere else and/or insufficiently different from others if you have collaborated or troubleshooted with other parties (including MSA team members and the content created by them in this repository), you may not be invited to any events and activities as part of the non-technical component of Phase 2.

## Support

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact the MSA team via our:

## Microsoft Azure Sign-Up Instructions

Before starting Phase 2, you will need to sign up for an Azure for Students subscription using your institution email using one of the methods described below. Azure for Students will give you $100 credit and free services to use within 12 months of signing up. After you use your credit, wait until the 12 months are over and sign up again if youâ€™re still a student. You'll get $100 credit and free services just like before.

1. If you **do not have an Azure account** using your institution email:
    -  Go to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) and click **Start for free**
    -  Sign in using your institution email
        - If you are based at the University of Auckland, your university email is already associated with a Microsoft account so do not create a new account using your university email, simply sign in.
        - If you are based at a different institution, check whether your institution has already provided you with a Microsoft account by trying to sign in first (if that doesn't work, create a new account using your institution email)
    - Follow the prompts to verify your academic status

2. If you **already have an Azure account** using your institution email:
    - Sign in to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students)
    - You will most likely be shown how much credit you have remaining and when your Azure for Students subscription expires if it has not expired yet, or prompted to renew if it has expired.

3. If you have **graduated and your institution no longer allows you to access your institution email** or you are facing issues using your institution email:
    - Please use a personal email that you can regularly access to sign up for an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq). Note that signing up this way means you will not be signing up for an Azure for Students subcription. To avoid incurring costs, we recommend that you only use and create services from the [Free service page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/FreeServicesBlade) in the Azure portal.

After you have completed the steps above, you should be directed to the [Education page of the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=e940c73ae3ec44b1852cb836987cef3e#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/overview) - this is where you can see how much credit you have remaining, how many days until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and other helpful resources.

Please see [the FAQs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq#azure-for-students) regarding eligibility requirements and more useful information about Azure for Students.

Note:
- Keep an eye on your Azure spending! If you use Azure for Students, you will not be charged anything or any charges you do incur will come from your $100 credit because we have designed this part to only use services available within Azure for Students (which are either always free or cost some amount to use that will be taken from your credit). 

- If you only use the services within Azure for Students, it will be extremely difficult for you to use up the entire $100 credit, but if your usage results in your credit being depleted to $0, you won't be able to get more credit until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and you'll have to move to [pay as you go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-cxa).

- MSA is not responsible for and will not refund or cancel any costs you personally incur due to services that you use. You may also refer to [Azure Sponsorships](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com) website to keep track of your Azure for Students subscription usage.
